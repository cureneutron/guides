    What is 'rolling a wormhole' and how do I do it?
---
## Introduction

So, you might have heard of the terms "rolling wormholes" and "rolling ships" and have been wondering what the fuck they are
Basically, every wormhole has a max amount of mass that can go through it before it collapses, and a max amount of mass that can go through each jump
and by doing "passes" aka going through and back with ships that are close to the maximum amount of mass that can go through,
we can kill bad/dangerous wormholes, or get better statics than the ones we have (since statics spawn a wormhole of the same type after being rolled).
We call this process "rolling wormholes", and the ships and fits we use "rolling ships"

## Overview

## General Information About Rolling

Rolling mass amounts are discussed in very large units, called Gigagrams (Gg) or Kilotons (kT). They are both equal to
1,000,000 kg of mass. The superior unit of measurement is however the "Rolling Unit", or RU, which is 100,000,000 kg, or 100 Gg/kT

Ship mass is given in Kg in both the fitting window and the various fitting programs (EFT/Pyfa), so you're gonna have to move decimal places around sometimes.
Also, ship mass is increased when you activate a prop mod (MWD or an Afterburner), by a set amount dictated by the module size,
so a large afterburner and a large MWD increase the mass by the same amount)

Activating a prop mod increases the mass of your ship.  An AB and a MWD of equal size give an equal mass increase.


## General Info About Wormholes
Wormholes have 3 important statistics that we'll keep track of here: the wormhole mass, age and type.

### Wormhole Mass
All wormholes "reduce" when they hit 50% of the total mass allowed through ("This wormhole has had its stability reduced by ships passing through it, but not to a critical degree yet"),
and "crit" when there's only 10% mass left (aka 90% of total allowed mass jumped through) ("This wormhole has had its stability critically disrupted by the mass of numerous ships passing through and is on the verge of collapse." )
You can and should regularly check whether a wormhole is reduced, crit or normal (above 50% mass left) by right clicking and pressing "show info" on the wormhole itself
(if it's normal, it will say "This wormhole has not yet had its stability significantly disrupted by ships passing through it." )
All wormholes also have a 10% deviation to their mass amount, so a hole with 30 RU of mass can have anywhere between 27 and 33 RU worth of mass.

### Wormhole age
Wormholes also have another stat that you should keep track of, namely their age. Generally, all wormholes last from between 16 and 24 hours, depending on the wormhole type, with few exceptions

~~~
"This wormhole has not yet begun its natural cycle of decay and should last at least another day."  -- means 24+ hours left
"This wormhole is beginning to decay, and probably won't last another day."                         -- means under 24 hours left
"This wormhole is reaching the end of its natural lifetime."                                        -- less than 4 hours left 
"This wormhole is on the verge of dissipating into the ether."                                      -- imminent collapse, you generally won't see this unless ccp fucks up
~~~

### Wormhole types
For the autist, this is invaluable information, as you can be smart about rolling unknown holes only when you know their type.
Wormhole type is the O447, or K162 or something else written on the overview, you should also mark this down in siggy, as it's important.
Generally, the important thing to know is that K162 are "incoming" wormholes, aka statics of other wormholes connecting to us or another wormhole, and
that they can be rolled without popping back again, while other holes are usually statics that will respawn (if it's written as such in siggy), or other holes connecting from the hole in question

For more information on different types of holes, consult this website until we get a proper table here: http://www.ellatha.com/eve/wormholelist.asp

## General Info About Rolling Ships
We use specially fit ships, mostly Megathrons for rolling, and cheap Thoraxes for "threading" holes that are crit (and shouldn't be jumped by a battleship)
These have 2 states, depending on if the prop mod (MWD/Afterburner) is turned on or off. When it's on, the ship is "hot" and when it's off, it's "cold"
Here are the mass numbers of the different ships used:

~~~
- Hot Higgs Mega      - 300 Gg (3 RU)
- Cold Higgs Mega     - 200 Gg (2RU)
- Hot Unrigged Mega   - 150 Gg (1,5 RU)
- Cold Unrigged Mega  - 100 Gg (1 RU)
- Hot Higgs Thorax    - 125 Gg (1,25 RU)
- Cold Higgs Thorax   - 25 Gg (0,25 RU)
~~~

Megathron alternatives include: Tempests, Ravens, Apocalypses. The most important thing to get is a Large Higgs Anchor rig and a
Large MWD/Afterburner, rest is up to you (some tank and cap mods/rigs are recommended)

Thorax alternatives include: any t1 cruiser equipped with a Medium Higgs Anchor rig and an oversized (100mn/500mn) propulsion module.

## All-Out Rolling

### All-Out Statics
Both of All-out's statics have 20 RU's worth of mass, which is 18-22 RU's worth of mass when we count in the mass deviation (This is important).
They also have a 300Gg (3 RU) of mass limit that can go through at one time. This is good, because cancer like carriers and dreads can't come in and evict us.
This is also bad because you can't bring anything heavier than that in or out of the hole.


#### The brainlet's rolling process

First of all, make sure you're in a rolling battleship on the home side of the hole. Then follow this:

1.)Cold (out) - Hot (back)
2.)Cold (out) - Hot (back)

Now check if the hole is reduced. If it is, do:

3.a)Cold (out) - Hot (back)
4.a)Cold (out) - Hot (back)

If it is not reduced, do:

3.b)Hot (out) - Hot (back)
4.b)Hot (out) - Hot (back)

This applies to holes that haven't had battleships or multiple battlecruisers jump them, aka "fresh" holes.
Wormholes that had significant mass go through them will sometimes reduce or close early, so refer to the procedure below.
 
#### NEVER JUMP ROLLING BATTLESHIPS THROUGH CRIT ("Verge of collapse") WORMHOLES UNLESS YOU INTEND TO CLOSE THEM ON THAT PASS



#### Someone Messed Up and I Just Realized the Regular Jumps Will Roll Me Out if I Keep Doing Them

Sometimes, you will experience this, and feel the incredible urge to murder the someone who fucked up. Here's what you do after the killing is taken care of:
Best plan is to do some envelope-math with masses to figure out exactly where you stand and what to do, but if you don't want to do that here are rules of thumb:

- Do Cold Hot or Hot Hot Passes until the Wormhole reduces (reaches"This wormhole has had its stability reduced by ships passing through it, but not to a critical degree yet" description)
- After it has reduced, do 1 set of Cold Hot passes
- Now you have 3 options:
1)1.)Be a hero and do another Cold Hot pass with a battleship. Ask Satori for medal if you get rolled out.
2)2.)Be a pragmatic man - do a Cold jump, STAY on the external side, and ask a corpmate to use a Thorax to do Hot-Hot passes until the wormhole crits, while you sit on the external side. If the wormhole crits while you are both outside of home, the Thorax should go back first Cold, followed by the battleship jumping Hot. This is known as "threading"
3)3.)Be a martyr and just do Hot Hot Thorax passes for 30 minutes.


#### There are very bad men and I can't roll, but I want to roll. What do I do?

1)1.)Make sure the chain you're rolling has a k-space exit. Ideally, you found one even before bad men appeared. The chances of getting rolled out with this technique are big.
2)2.)Acquire Yacht (see below)
3)3.)Ruin the game for everyone

Explanation: Victorieux Luxury Yachts are limited edition ships given away as perfect travel ships - being able to fit covert ops cloaks, and immune to interdiction bubbles. However, wormhole residents, in the peak of their cowardice and ingenuity, discovered that these ships have somewhat large mass, and that they can be used for risk-free rolling: they can cloak to avoid being tackled, and they are naturally immune to bubbles.

To successfully roll with a Yacht, you:

1) Warp to the desired wormhole at 0, cloaking as you warp.
2) As you land, decloak, activate AB, jump the wormhole with no delay
3) As you spawn on the other side, you warp to a random celestial, anomaly or safespot at a hundred. You press warp and cloak in quick succession - otherwise, lucky campers will start locking you before you cloak.
4) You warp back to the wormhole at 0, decloak, jump it again
5) On the home side, you warp either to a safe spot or to a citadel.
6) YOU DO NOT UNDER ANY CONDITIONS BURN AROUND THE WORMHOLE IN A YACHT, CLOAKED OR NOT. ALWAYS WARP OFF

Bonus trivia:

- Why does the Yacht have no Higgs anchor?

Because Higgs anchor rigs disable interdiction bubble immunity, making the ship pointless.

- Why not do this with an interceptor/nullified tier 3?

Lower mass.

- Should I buy Yachts and reprocess them to stop this risk-averse cancer?

Yes.

#### HIC rolling

You can also use the malignant cancer known as a HIC, or a Heavy Interdiction Cruiser to roll. 
It is also a much more fail-proof way of rolling crit holes (aka "threading"), since hics can mount multiple warp disruption field generators (unscripted), and activate them all at the same time in order to drop their mass to sub-frigate levels.
